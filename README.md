# Examples of Disciplined Nonlinear Programming
This repository contains examples accompanying the paper [Disciplined Nonlinear Programming](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/dnlp.html). Each example demonstrates solving a nonlinear optimization problem using CVXPY.

### How to run these examples
After installing the [DNLP](https://github.com/cvxgrp/DNLP) package you should be able to run these examples.
